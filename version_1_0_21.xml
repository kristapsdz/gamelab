			Address a number of small issues encountered in live trials: <q>join</q> players after answering the last question
			instead of when they actually try to play the first round, add administrator notice of running the mailer process,
			disallow negative accumulated tickets (in the event of negative payoffs) from crashing the system.
			(This last part will be later fixed even more.)
			Make the administrative console even clearer.
			Bring the manual up to date with the current system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also hard-code the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> at compilation time instead of
			within source files, allowing administrators to deploy their own icon server instead for LAN environments.

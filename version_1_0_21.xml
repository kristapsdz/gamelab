			Address a number of small issues encountered in live trials: <q>join</q> players after answering the last question
			instead of when they actually try to play the first round, add administrator notice of running the mailer process,
			disallow negative accumulated tickets (in the event of negative payoffs) from crashing the system.
			(This last part will be later fixed even more.)
			Make the administrative console even clearer.
			Remove the <var>end</var> variable from the experiment table (unused) and properly reset (upon wiping) the
			<var>total</var> variable as 0, not 0/1.
			Fix a presentation bug in showing hypothetical payoffs where the payoffs were fractional and the payoff would show zero
			instead of the fractional result.
			Bring the manual up to date with the current system, partially documenting the JSON API in the process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Add the ability for the administrator to disable history altogether.
			This prevents the history of other players' plays from being transmitted, effectively making games <q>history-free</q>.
			This is useful for testing the difference in play between information sets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also hard-code the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> at compilation time instead of
			within source files, allowing administrators to deploy their own icon server instead for LAN environments.

			Now that the session identifiers are properly embedded, remove support for the Mechanical Turk <q>survey link</q>
			functionality, which was just a crutch.

			as well as whether the request is to be sandboxed.
			Also make sure that all Mechanical Turk variables (worker, assignment, and HIT identifiers) are proper uppercase
			alphanumeric strings.

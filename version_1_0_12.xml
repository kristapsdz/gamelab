			Begin adding support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/mturk/">Mechanical Turk</a>.
			Experiments employing mturk use the same process as before to start a <q>captive</q> experiment.
			Unlike in normal captive experiments, however, the application makes available a special URL for submitting as an mturk
			<q>HIT</q>.
			This URL acts like the captive portal except both registers and logs in participants, immediately pushing them through
			to the lobby (or directly into the game, if so configured).
			The fact that players are mturk-registered is logged and displayed when reviewing player status.

			While here, clean up the lottery-winning (and non-lottery-winning) interface for players.
			Just polish: nothing exceptional.

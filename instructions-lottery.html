<p>Welcome to the experiment!</p>
<p>
You are participating in an experiment in which you will use this web page to play a number of
games.  Depending on your own and others' choices you can earn a substantial amount of money by
winning a lottery at the end of the experiment.  Your chances to win the lottery depend in part on
how well you understand these instructions, so read them carefully.
</p>
<p>
Below you will find all the information you need to participate. Feel free to contact <a
	href="mailto:@@gamelab-admin-email@@">@@gamelab-admin-email@@</a> if you have any additional
questions.
</p>
<h3>Experimental overview</h3>
<p>
The experiment is divided into @@gamelab-rounds@@ rounds and each round is open during
@@gamelab-round-time@@ hours.  In each round you play @@gamelab-games@@ games.  These games are the
same in all rounds.
</p>
<p>
In all games you have the opportunity to get payoffs depending how you and others play.  Your
payoffs are calculated as soon as a round closes, given that you have played all @@gamelab-games@@
games in the round.
</p>
<p>
When a new round begins you can view your payoffs from the previous round directly on the
<q>Play</q> tab.  A more detailed summary of your payoffs for each game from all previous rounds,
along with the total sum of your payoffs, is available on the <q>History</q> tab.
</p>
<h3>Game setup</h3>
<p>
Each game is represented in a game bimatrix (a table) where one player chooses row and the other
column.  You are a row player in all games and rounds.  Your payoff is the first number in each cell
and will always have the color of this box: <i class="gamelab-colour fa fa-square"></i>.  The column
player's payoff is the second number in each cell and will always have the color of this box: <i
	class="gamelab-ocolour fa fa-square"></i>.
</p>
<p>
When you play you may either select a pure strategy (one row) or a mixed strategy (a probability
distribution over the rows).  In the first case, you assign probability one to the row you want to
play.  In the second case, you select positive probabilities for multiple rows, as long as they sum
to one.  Your choice of strategy is your private information and is never shared with any other
participant.
</p>
<p>
When you have decided on a strategy (pure or mixed), click on each row that is included in your
strategy and assign the corresponding probability in the input field.  Any row that you don't select
will be assigned probability zero.  Once this is done, click the <q>Submit Play</q> button to submit
your play.
</p>
<p>
After you have submitted your play, click the <q>Go to next game</q> button to proceed to the next
game.
</p>
<h3>Payoffs</h3>
<p>
After each round, you are matched against all column players and your strategy is played against
each of their strategies.  In each game, you are given the average payoff of your strategy against
all column players.
</p>
<p>
Your final payoff from a round is calculated as the sum of your payoffs from all @@gamelab-games@@
games.  Your overall payoff in the experiment is the sum of your final payoffs from all rounds.
</p>
<p>
You can view information about your previous payoffs at the <q>History</q> tab at any time.
</p>
<h3>Lottery tickets and picking the winner</h3>
<p>
At the end of the experiment your overall payoff is transformed into the equivalent number of
lottery tickets.  (Should your overall payoff be a non-integer number, we will round off upwards.)
Each lottery ticket will be assigned a unique number. Out of all tickets to all participants in the
experiment, one lottery ticket will be randomly drawn to win a prize of 10 000 SEK.
</p>
<p>
In drawing the winning ticket, we will use the Swedish Lotto system.  More exactly, we will use a
quasi-random process in which an initial seed determines the winning number (the exact code is
available upon request).  To make sure that the initial seed is completely random it will be
determined by a random draw by a third party.  More precisely, the seed will be the
<q>Till√§ggsnummer</q> from the first <q><a target="_blank" 
		href="https://svenskaspel.se/?pageid=/resultat/lottolordag">Lotto 1</a></q> draw
after the final round of the experiment.
</p>
<p>
Once the initial seed is drawn, the winning lottery ticket will be computed and the winner will be
contacted.
</p>
<h3>History of play</h3>
<p>
You can view how a game was played in the previous round by looking at the history table directly on
the <q>Play</q> tab when playing that game.  A full summary of play in all previous rounds is
available on the <q>History</q> tab.
</p>
<p>
The history table summarizes how players in both roles (including you) have played in the previous
round.  The number in the white cells in the matrix shows the share of plays that ended in that cell
in the last round.  The first number in the gray cells shows in what share of plays that row or
column strategy was used.  The number in brackets in the gray cells to the right show your payoff,
represented by [U], should you have played the pure strategy associated with each row in the
previous round.
</p>
<p>
An example of a history table:
</p>
<div class="history" style="max-width: 20em;">
	<div>
		<div style="width: 1%;" class="labelaside"></div>
		<div style="width: 32%;" class="labelatop">A</div>
		<div style="width: 32%;" class="labelatop">B</div>
		<div style="width: 32%;" class="sumaside">&#x2211; 
			[<span class="gamelab-colour">U</span>]</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="labelatop">a</div>
		<div class="mix">0.315</div>
		<div class="mix">0.585</div>
		<div class="sumaside sum">0.900 
			[<span class="gamelab-colour">U</span>]</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="labelatop">b</div>
		<div class="mix">0.035</div>
		<div class="mix">0.065</div>
		<div class="sumaside sum">0.100 
			[<span class="gamelab-colour">U</span>]</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="labelaside">&#x2211;</div>
		<div class="sumbelow sum">0.350</div>
		<div class="sumbelow sum">0.650</div>
		<div class="sumaside"></div>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
From the history table we see that the share of plays ending in the combination <q>a</q> and
<q>A</q> was 0.315 in the last round while the share of plays ending in <q>a</q> and <q>B</q> was
0.585.  Looking at the numbers in the gray cells we see that the share of plays in which row players
played <q>a</q> was 0.9, and the share in which column players played <q>B</q> was 0.650.

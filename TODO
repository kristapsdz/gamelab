Short-term:

- Have a "question mark" entry of "History" on the play page that explains
  what the labels (e.g., "Hyp.") mean.

Long-term:

- Have SurveyLink random value (for HIT confirmation) be a random number
  per user and be part of the CSV that's downloaded.
- Have the shown graphs on the history use the radio-button trick, not 
  Javascript.

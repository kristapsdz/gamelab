Short-term:

- Have a "question mark" entry of "History" on the play page that explains
  what the labels (e.g., "Hyp.") mean.

- Have SurveyLink random value (for HIT confirmation) be a random number
  per user and be part of the CSV that's downloaded.

- Add per-user administration showing whether they've played.
  (Played rounds?  Current payoff?  Etc.)

- E-mail all players telling players that round has rolled.

Long-term:

- Have the shown graphs on the history use the radio-button trick, not 
  Javascript.

- Kick players after inactivity.

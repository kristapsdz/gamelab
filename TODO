- allow admin to see passwords (captive players only)
- make sure that strategy order is consistent across matrix, chart
  legend, and chart "stack" position
- record screen dimensions when logging in!

- have a choice of round-advancement methods:
  (1) the traditional max-time based system
  (2) "roundpct" time with a "grace period"
      a. if all players play within the grace period, bump round
      b. otherwise, wait til end of grace period
  (3) none, administrator does all




- When player has reached end of round (but not end of experiment) show
  the accumulated TICKETS as well as PAYOFF.

- Allow for history to be "faked": allow a prior experiment's data (or
  multiple experiments' data) to be considered as "history".  The fake
  data won't be considered part of the new experiment's results: it's
  read-only in terms of history.

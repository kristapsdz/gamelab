			Renamed <q>auto-added</q> players as <q>captive</q>.
			Remove logout button for captive players.
			Remove <q>remember whether to see instructions</q> for captive players.
			Add cache-control mechanism for player JSON that depends on the current round, relieving the gamelab server of producing the
			full experiment JSON request with each reload.
			Added several useful bits of information to the database: client user-agent to each session (and sessions are now retained
			instead of deleted), creation time for each game-play, and link from game-play to active session (for source correlation).
			Merged <q>winning instruction</q> text [back] into template itself.

			Allow for Mechanical Turk players to log in using a survey link instead of the traditional <q>external question</q>.
			This is because <span class="nm">gamelab</span> requires cookies, and when logged in through Mechanical Turk, these
			cookies are <q>third-party</q> since they are fetched secondary to the Mechanical Turk interface.
			Some browsers will ignore these by default, such as Safari, putting an extra burden on players to allow cookies.
			In the future, we forsee allowing cookie values to be specified in the query string for Mechanical Turk players.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clean up some typos in the questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Significantly clean up the JavaScript front-end bits after running over them with <a
				href="http://jshint.com/">jshint</a>.
			Also fix some timer issues (timeouts not firing) raised during Mechanical Turk tests.
			Lastly, allow <q>malformed</q> decimal values like .5 instead of 0.5.
			After some user feedback, add a loud notification that the round has rolled.

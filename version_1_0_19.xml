			Allow for Mechanical Turk players to log in using a survey link instead of the traditional <q>external question</q>.
			This is because <span class="nm">gamelab</span> requires cookies, and when logged in through Mechanical Turk, these
			cookies are <q>third-party</q> since they are fetched from the Mechanical Turk interface.
			Some browsers will ignore these by default, such as Safari, putting an extra burden on players to allow cookies.
			In the future, we forsee allowing cookie values to be specified in the query string for Mechanical Turk players.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also clean up some typos in the questions.

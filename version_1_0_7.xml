			Introduce ability for players joining after the experiment has started.
			To do so, experimenters must specify a per-player maximum number of rounds as well as a per-experiment maximum.
			Players are added by the experimenter in the usual way.
			When the new players join after the experiment has begun, they wait in a <q>lobby</q> until a slot is available.
			Once a slot is available (the participant's new role is dynamically assigned as the role containing fewer players), the
			participant is automatically assigned to the next round.

		<p>
			Perform an audit of using <code>sqlite3_column_int</code> instead of <code>sqlite3_column_int64</code>, and make sure
			that all return values of <code>int64_t</code> are properly checked and cast.

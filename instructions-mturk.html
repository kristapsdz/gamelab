<p>
Welcome! In this HIT you will use this web page to play a number of games.
</p>
<h3>HIT overview</h3>
<p>
You will participate in @@gamelab-rounds@@ rounds.
</p>
<p>
Each round consists of choices for the same @@gamelab-games@@ games.  In addition to the HIT
completion fee you will earn a bonus payment that depends on your own and others' choices in the
games.  
</p>
<p>
Each round will last for at least XX minutes.  It will take approximately XX minutes to finish this
HIT.
</p>
<h3>Game setup</h3>
<p>
Each game is represented in a table where you always choose row(s). You will be playing with other
players, some also choose row(s) and others choose column(s). Your payoff (which contributes to your
bonus payment) for a given row and column combination is the first number in each cell, shown in <i
	class="gamelab-colour fa fa-square"></i>.  The column player's payoff is the second number
in each cell, shown in <i class="gamelab-ocolour fa fa-square"></i>.
</p>
<p>
Being a row player you will have to choose which row(s) to play. You can only get payoffs from the
row(s) you play. However, column players will be choosing which column(s) to play so you donâ€™t have
full control over which payoff you get.
</p>
<p>
When choosing row(s) you must give each played row a weight. A weight of 1 means that payoffs (for
you and the column player) will always be calculated based on that row. A weight of, for example 1/3
means that 1/3 of the payoffs will be calculated from that row. Any combination of weights is
possible as long as the sum of all weights is 1. Remember that the column(s) from which your payoffs
are calculated are chosen by the column players.  
</p>
<p>
To choose row(s), click all rows you want to play and then input the weight you
want to assign the rows you have selected in their corresponding fields. When you have selected rows
and weights, click the <q>Submit</q> button and then the <q>Go to next game</q> button to proceed to
the next game.
</p>
<h3>Bonus payments</h3>
<p>
Your payoff from a game depends on how you play (which row(s) you choose and the weight you assign
to the row(s)) and on how the column players play on average (which column(s) they choose and the
weight they assign to the column(s)).
</p>
<p>
At the end of the HIT your bonus payment will be calculated by summing your payoffs from all games
in all rounds and converting the points to US dollars at a 1 point = $XX rate. You must make choices
for all games in a round in order to receive bonus payments from that round.
</p>
<h3>History of play</h3>
<p>
To get information about a game in previous rounds you can look at the graphs on the play page and
on the <q>History</q> tab. The graphs gives you information about things such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Your previous payoffs.
	</li>
	<li> 
	How much payoff you would have gotten by choosing each row with full weight (1) in previous
	rounds.
	</li>
	<li>The average choices of the row and column players in previous rounds.</li>
</ul>

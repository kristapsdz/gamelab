    Welcome!
</p>
<p>
    In this study you will use this web page to play a number of games.
    To play, click the <i class="fa fa-navicon"></i> menu icon in the upper left-hand corner then click <q>Play</q>. 
    Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:@@gamelab-admin-email@@">@@gamelab-admin-email@@</a> if you have any additional questions.
</p>
<h3>Study overview</h3>
<p>
    The study is divided into a number of rounds. 
    In each round you and others will make decisions in @@gamelab-games@@ games.  
    These games are identical in all rounds.
</p>
<p>
    In each game you can earn tickets for a lottery that will take place after the final round. The number of tickets you earn
    depends on both your own and others' decisions in the games. The prize of the lottery is @@gamelab-lottery@@.
</p>
<p>
    Each round will last for at least @@gamelab-round-mintime-minutes@@
    minutes and will end when either @@gamelab-round-percent@@% of all
    participants have played or after @@gamelab-round-time-minutes@@ minutes
    have passed.
</p>
<h3>Game setup</h3>
<p>
    Each game is given in a table and you will have to choose one or more rows to play in each.
    You will then be matched against the other participants who will choose one or more columns.
</p>
<p>
    Your payoff for a given row and column combination is the first number in each cell, shown in <i class="gamelab-colour fa fa-square"></i>.
    The column player's payoff is the second number in each cell, shown in <i class="gamelab-ocolour fa fa-square"></i>.
    Each payoff point awards one lottery ticket at the end of the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    You will only get payoffs from the rows you choose to play.
    However, column players will be choosing which of the columns to play, so you won't have full control over the payoff you get.
</p>
<p>
    After you have chosen which rows to play you must assign a weight to
    each of these. 
    The weights must add up to <strong>1</strong>. 
    A weight of <strong>1</strong> means that payoffs (for you and the
    column player) will be calculated solely based on that row. 
    A smaller weight, for example <strong>1/3</strong>, means that <strong>1/3</strong> of your payoffs will
    be calculated from that row. 
    The columns from which your payoffs are calculated are chosen by the
    column players in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>
    To make a decision in a game, first click all rows you want to play and
    then input the weights you want to assign to them. 
    Once you have chosen rows and weights, click the <q>Submit play</q> button
    and then the <q>Go to next game</q> button to proceed to the next game.
</p>
<p>
    You must make decisions for all @@gamelab-games@@ games in a round in
    order to receive payoffs from that round.
</p>
<h3>Bonus payments</h3>
<p>
    Your payoffs from a game depend on the rows and weights you choose, as
    well as  how the column players choose on average. 
    Other players' payoffs are calculated in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the study your total payoffs will be calculated by summing
    your payoffs from all games in all rounds in which you have
    participated.
    Each payoff point awards one lottery ticket.
</p>
<h3>History of play</h3>
<p>
    The graphs on the play page and on the <q>History</q> tab provide
    information about the games and how they have been played in previous
    rounds. 
    This information includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your previous payoffs.
    </li>
    <li> 
        How much payoff you would have gotten by choosing each row with full weight (<strong>1</strong>) in previous
        rounds.
    </li>
    <li>
       The average choices of the row and column players in previous rounds.
    </li>
</ul>

			Fix the QualificationRequirement portion of the Mechanical Turk request and make qualifications be part of the
			configuration process.
			Add the facility to automatically submit <a
				href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_GrantBonusOperation.html">bonuses</a>
			to Mechanical Turk.
			This button is revealed after completion of the experiment if and only if the experiment is associated with AWS
			credentials.
			(Only Mechanical Turk players are notified of their bonus, of course.)
			Fix the <q>Finish</q> notification to Mechanical Turk to be through the gamelab system, not the client's browser: this
			behaviour is usually disallowed as a browser security option.

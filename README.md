## Synopsis

[Gamelab](https://gametheorylab.org) is an online game theory laboratory
where participants assign mixed strategies to game bimatrices over a series of
rounds, accumulating payoffs as the experiment progresses. The mission of
gamelab is to allow for laboratory-style interaction without the need for a
laboratory. 

This repository is a read-only mirror of gamelab's master CVS repository.
For all questions regarding gamelab, please consult the
[manual](https://gametheorylab.org/manual.html).
Unless you have a specific reason to use bleeding-edge code, we strongly
suggest that you use a release version of gamelab as found on the main
site.

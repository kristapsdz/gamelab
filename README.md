## Synopsis

[Gamelab](http://www.kcons.eu/gamelab) is an online game theory laboratory
where participants assign mixed strategies to game bimatrices over a series of
rounds, accumulating payoffs as the experiment progresses. The mission of
gamelab is to allow for laboratory-style interaction without the need for a
laboratory.

			Allow Mechanical Turk players to log back in with the same HTI identifier.
			Moreover, don't unset mturk status (on the experimenter side) when experiments begin: mturk players can only log in
			after the experiment commences anyway, so this is useless.
			Show experimenters a message when mturk or captive players are enabled consisting of the necessary links.

			Put graphs of current game into <q>Play</q> tab for easier reference.

		Added an <q>auto-add</q> mode where, upon being set by the administrator, participants can register themselves for games.
		This makes it easier to deploy gamelab in a setting (e.g., laboratory, classroom) where participants' e-mail addresses are not
		known or where the e-mail verification phase would take too much time.
		The administrative console has also been overhauled and now allows for saving experiments before deployment.
		HTTPS access is fully enabled for all components.

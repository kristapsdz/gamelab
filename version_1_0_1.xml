		Second [non-public] release of the system.
		The push behind this release is to reduce the load on the Gamelab server: a lot of HTML and JavaScript which previously had been
		dynamically served is now statically served.
		The paths in these files (which were previously filled-in by the server) are now hard-coded during compilation.

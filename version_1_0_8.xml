			Add the ability to test out game deployments with an automated <q>bot</q> player utility.
			This utility simulates participants who connect, register, and play through a simulation.
			The play is maximally disruptive (extremely high-frequency attempts) to establish limits of <span
				class="nm">gamelab</span> installations.
			The <q>bot</q> player will be used as a proof-of-concept for fully programmatic play, wherein participants can program a
			bot to play on their behalf.
			This feature will be documented and described in later releases of <span class="nm">gamelab</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In doing so, fix a very subtle bug in how round advancement occurs with <q>percent-based</q> play.
			Also, change the database to use <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead logging</a>, which reduces the
			amount of lock contention in heavily-loaded experiments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Smaller changes: fixed up the manual with more specific language; simplified the experimenter's <q>Experiment
				Parameters</q> panel; and fixed the experimenter instructions (their template values we're being filled in).

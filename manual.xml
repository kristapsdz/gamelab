				<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> is an online game theory laboratory where participants assign mixed strategies

				The mission of <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is to allow for laboratory-style interaction without the
				need for a laboratory.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the user's manual for <span class="nm">gamelab</span>.
				(There's also a <a href="quickstart.html">quickstart</a> guide.)
				Its purpose is to <a href="#intro">introduce</a> the system, then describe how to <a href="#deploy">deploy</a>
				it and how to <a href="#administration">run experiments</a>.
			</p>
			<section id="intro">
				<header>
					<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> is an online laboratory for conducting game theory experiments.
					Experiments consist of an experimenter, an experiment configuration, participants, and a set of games.
					The web interface accomodates for desktop, mobile, and tablet-sized devices.
					You can even play experiments programatically over a JSON API.
				</p>
				<p>
					An experimenter begins by configuring&#8212;among many other parameters&#8212;how rounds in the
					experiment progress and for how long the experiment will run.
					Once the experimenter deploys the experiment, participants can log in and play each game once per round.
					When the round advances, participants earn points by computing the payoff from their submitted strategies
					against the average mixture submited by participants playing the opponent player role.
					After the last round, participants' points award lottery tickets, and winners (if winners are part of
					the configuration) are drawn by selecting lottery tickets.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> has many configurable parameters, for example, round advancement based
					on number of participants who have played; computing or not computing lotteries; <a
						href="#mechanicalturk">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> integration; captive
					<q>laboratory-based</q> participants who cannot log out or back in; and so on.
				</p>
				<section id="participants">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Participants</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Experiment participants are identified by an e-mail address, an opaque identifier in
						<q>captive</q> configurations, or a worker identifier in Mechanical Turk configurations (this is effectively a captive scenario).
						An experiments can have as many participants as the server (or the experimenter!) can handle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Participants are assigned by the experimenter, assign themselves in a <q>captive</q> 
						configuration, or join from <a href="#mechanicalturk">Mechanical Turk</a> console.
						In the first case, participants are e-mailed a password and login credentials when the
						experimenter begins the experiment.
						(If no e-mail server has been configured, they are not e-mailed.)
						These participants can log in and log out over the course of the experiment.
						In the latter cases, participants are not e-mailed, and are assumed to be <q>captive</q> (i.e.,
						they cannot log out or back in) for the duration of the experiment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Participants may be added (or add themselves) before an experiment begins, so that participation
						is static; or be added (or add themselves) both before and after the experiment has begun.
						In this dynamic case, experimenters can limit the number of simultaneous participants, allowing
						for a constant flow of participants joining and leaving the system as the experiment progresses.
						Participants that have logged in but cannot yet play due to the concurrent-participant limit are
						placed in a <q>lobby</q> until they join the experiment.
						(The same lobby is also used for the <a href="#questionnaire">Questionnaire</a>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						When the experiment begins or when participants otherwise join, participants are randomly
						assigned a player role (row or column) used for all games throughout the experiment.
						Experiments always have an equal assignment of row and column player participants unless the total number of
						participants is odd, in which case the extra participant is assigned a random role.
						If participants join after the experiment has started, they are assigned to a player role that
						balances role counts at the time of assignment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="questionnaire">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						The experimenter may stipulate that participants step through a questionnaire before being
						allowed to play.
						In this treatment, participants are initially dropped into a <q>lobby</q> where they must answer
						questions before beginning.
						(This lobby is also used to handle an overflow of participants as defined in the <a
							href="#participants">Participants</a> section.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The questionnaire is designed to ensure that participants know how to play with minimum bias
						toward a given configuration.
						Results are recorded (duration of answering, number of tries, etc.) so experimenters may
						correlate performance with outcome.
					</p>
					<p>
						Experimenters may customise their questionnaire manually when creating their
						experiment&#8212;please contact us if you need guidance in doing so.
						You'll be able, in doing so, to stipulate any number of free-form questions to ask your
						participants before they can begin.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="games">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Games</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						A game in <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is simply a payoff bi-matrix.
						Payoffs are rationally-valued numbers.
						(<strong>Note</strong>: negative participant tickets will cause the lottery computation to fail.)
						There is no limit to the number of strategies for this matrix; however, in practise, only so
						many columns fit neatly on a small screen.
						Games larger than four or five strategies wide will look funny.
						Each experiment can have as many games as desired.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="gameplay">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Game-play</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Once the participant joins an experiment, participants can submit game-plays, one per game per
						round.
						A game-play consists of a strategy mixture: a set of probabilities assigned to each of the
						player role's actions.
						The submitted probabilities are non-negative and rationally-valued, and always sum to one.
						Participants submit these probabilites by clicking on rows in the game matrix (participants appear to
						play the row player regardless of their player role) and entering in a decimal or rational
						number corresponding to the action.
					</p>
					<p>
						Participants can only play one game at a time, with each game played once per round.
						If they log out and log back in (an action available only to non-captive participants), then the last game
						to play is displayed, assuming the round has not advanced in the meantime.
						Game matrices have their rows and columns randomly shuffled between participants, making it
						slightly more difficult to compare actions.
						Moreover, the order in which games are displayed is randomised between participants.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the conclusion of each round, participants who have submitted mixtures for all games have their
						payoffs computed as points.
						(Rounds with incomplete games yield zero points.)
						Points are computed by playing the participant's mixture against the average mixture of
						participants in the opposing player role.
						Only opposing role participants who have played all games are considered.
						The points are then computed from the game payoffs.
						All of these calculations are over rational numbers and are unaffected by rounding.
						If not enough participants have played in a given player role, no points are tallied for the
						round.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the first round, participants can review the full history of play.
						This includes the history of their own strategy mixture, the average opponent role mixture, and
						the participant role's average mixture.
						Moreover, it includes the participant's accumulation of points, points per round, and the
						hypothetical points per round of playing pure strategies.
						Experimenters may also provide a <q>seed</q> history that is prepended to the actual history of
						play. 
						This allows the results of prior experiments to be incorporated into the current one.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="lottery">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Lottery</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						When a participant has exceeded her maximum allowed rounds, she is no longer able to submit
						plays to the experiment.
						When all rounds have concluded, the experiment halts.
						Participants may still log in and review the history, as well as see the total number of points
						awarded and their lottery ticket allotment.
						The lottery ticket allotment is computed by rounding up the participant's total payoffs.
						<strong>Note</strong>: Mechanical Turk players are not included in the lottery computation, nor
						are they shown any information pertaining to the lottery.
					</p>
					<p>
						The experimenter may then trigger the lottery from the console.
						(Experiments may also run without a lottery.)
						This consists of seeding a deterministic random number generator with a given value.
						Each of these values is mapped into the lottery tickets to choose a winner.
						A participant is only chosen once for winning: if the random number re-selects a participant,
						a new number is drawn (rejection sampling).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note</strong>: if any final allotments are less than zero, the lottery uses
						negative-valued semantics as follows.  First, all allotments are offset by the minimum
						(negative) allotment.  For example, if the smallest allotment is -11, all allotments are
						increased by 11.  Then lottery is then computed from these non-negative adjustment allotments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon triggering winner selection, winner participants are notified on their login screen, along
						with the lottery ticket causing the win.
						This is for transparency of the winner selection.
						Non-winning participants are also notified.
					</p>

				<header>
					<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
					<h2>Technicalities</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> uses a broad set of technologies to work.
					In this section, I briefly describe the specific technologies used.
					All of this is visible in the source code, but let this act as a primer.
					In general, these can be broken down into the user interface, which experimenters and participants use,
					and the server backend, which is accessed by the user interface.
				</p>
				<section id="userinterface">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>User Interface</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						The <q>user interface</q> to <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is via a web browser.
						In general, the user interface involves an HTML5 web-page styled with CSS.
						Both HTML and CSS have been carefully validated using the 
						<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> and
						<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validation Service</a>, respectively.
						These web-page uses JavaScript to request data from the <span class="nm">gamelab</span> server
						via a series of JSON objects.
						The JavaScript used by <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is fairly recent, so it's unlikely that
						older browser will work properly.
						(It has, however, been checked over with <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> and other
						related services.)
						Check that your browser supports <code>ClassList</code>, <code>FormData</code>, and of course
						<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (<q>AJAX</q>).
					</p>
					<p>
						Graphs play a significant role in <span class="nm">gamelab</span>.
						The interface includes a local copy of <a
							href="http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/">flotr2</a> for drawing line and bar graphs.
						These graphs will display properly on any modern web browser.
					</p>
					<p>
						The interface is styled with the 
						<a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> icon set.
						The path to the icon configuration may be provided during compilation, and defaults to the on-line repository.
					</p>
					<p>
						A copy of
						<a href="https://github.com/EvanHahn/HumanizeDuration.js">HumanizeDuration.js</a> is also
						bundled with the system for displaying readable time durations.
					</p>
					<p>
						The user interface also makes use of cookies to store your session materials.
						<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> cookies themselves don't store any identifiable material: they
						store only the server session identifier and a random number to prevent sharing of session
						identifiers.
						The system will also operate with session information embedded in URLs, but this is only
						enabled for <a href="#mechanicalturk">Mechanical Turk</a> play.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="backend">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Server Backend</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						The backend of <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is a <a href="https://learnbchs.org">BCHS</a>
						system consisting of two compiled CGI programs: one for the experimenter, one for participants.
						These are small ISO C applications linking to a number of open source libraries.
						Consult the <a href="#deploy">Deployment</a> section for how to install these libraries.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> has been run on OpenBSD with httpd and the historical Apache,
						Mac OS X with Apache2, and Linux with Apache.
						System administrators are not encouraged to use Apache2 since it disallows long-running child processes
						of the CGI scripts.
						Such processes are used in several circumstances.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="numformat">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Number Format</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Internally, <span class="nm">gamelab</span> stores all non-integer numbers (strategy mixtures,
						payoffs, etc.) as rational numbers encoded as strings.
						These rational numbers are manipulated by <a href="http://gmplib.org">GMP</a> routines.
						The reason behind using rational numbers is precision: while the numbers themselves may grow
						quite large in size (if they compound), the library ensures that no roundoff occurs when
						tallying points.
					</p>
					<p>
						No floating-point numbers are used for internal tallies, although these are distributed to the
						web frontend for more intuitive representation.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="randomness">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Randomness</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Matrix ordering and player role, among other subsystems, require a
						non-deterministic random number generator.
						To accomplish this, <span class="nm">gamelab</span> uses the BSD <a
							href="http://man.openbsd.org/arc4random.3">arc4random</a>
						system interface to provide high-quality randomness.
						This is emulated with <a href="https://wiki.freedesktop.org/libbsd/">libbsd</a> on GNU/Linux.
						The lottery computation uses a deterministic random number generator using an
						experimenter-defined seed: this allows lottery draws to be repeatable.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note</strong>: if you're running on GNU/Linux, you may not benefit from the high quality
						randomness, as well as the general security and reliability, of BSD systems.
						We strongly encourage BSD as a platform of choice, especially <a
							href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, which is the main development platform.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="security">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Security</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> is designed with security in mind, but inherits most of its
						security from the operating system.
						In the recommended <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> deployment configuration, <span
							class="nm">gamelab</span> binaries are statically compiled and run within a file-system
						jail.
						You can effect the same conditions on any well-configured web server configuration, however.
						On any supported system, the library used to communicate with the web server, <a
							href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi">kcgi</a>, is heavily invested in security.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <q>logical</q> security of the application itself is proportionate to the data security.
						Passwords are stored in clear-text because participants cannot actually change the passwords:
						they are opaque tokens (<q>cookies</q>).
						The only security-sensitive information on the server is the e-mail server password and the AWS
						secret key if provided for <a href="#mechanicalturk">Mechanical Turk</a> configurations.
					</p>
					<p>
						To protect against misbehaving linked libraries that can access the network, the <span
							class="nm">gamelab</span> executables do enforce a strict process separation when
						invoking any e-mail or network-access functions.
						The rational-number and database libraries are used within the main processing context, however.
					</p>

					<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
					<h2>Deployment</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> is a CGI application that runs under any CGI-compatible web server on a
					modern UNIX system.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to use <span class="nm">gamelab</span>, you'll need to download, configure, and install
					it&mdash;just like any piece of software.
					If a system administrator has already installed the server and given you the web address for its
					laboratory and experimenter interfaces, jump down to the <a href="#administration">Experimenters</a>
					section.
				</p>
				<p>
					If at any time you have problems during an installation, or you encounter confusing language, please
					e-mail <a href="mailto:kristaps@kcons.eu">Kristaps</a> with the issue.
					If you'd rather use a pre-installed environment, please visit <a
						href="https://gametheorylab.org">gametheorylab.org</a>.
				</p>
				<section id="environment">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Environment</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						To operate a <span class="nm">gamelab</span> server, you'll need a modern UNIX system with a web
						server accessable to your participants.
						You are encouraged to use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, which is the default
						testing and development environment.
						I don't discuss web server deployment in this manual: please consult your operating system
						documentation on how to do so.
						Specifically, you'll want to research on how to enable CGI scripts.
						FastCGI is also possible, but not the default installation.
					</p>
					<p>
						To date, <span class="nm">gamelab</span> has been deployed on Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, and a number
						of BSD systems.
						It has been run under the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> web server, 
						<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> via <a
							href="http://man.openbsd.org/slowcgi.8">slowcgi(8)</a>,
						and OpenBSD's <a
							href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a> via
						<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/slowcgi.8">slowcgi(8)</a>.
						The system is designed to run in a <q>jail</q> as is the default with OpenBSD <a
							href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>.
						You are encouraged to do the same in any environment for security reasons; however, the system
						will also run fine in a non-jail context.
					</p>
					<p>
						As mentioned in <a href="#backend">Backend</a>, many configurations have been tested: only <a
							href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache2</a> is known to have issues, and these generally are
						harmless.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="dependencies">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Dependencies</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						With your <a href="#environment">environment</a> prepared, you'll need to download the <span
							class="nm">gamelab</span> source code as well as its dependencies.
						These are <i>compile-time</i> dependencies, so if the system compiles, it will run just fine.
						There are no additional run-time dependencies.
						The dependencies consist of the following:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv">kcgi</a> (the CGI framework),</li>
						<li><a href="https://gmplib.org">GMP</a> (rational number library),</li>
						<li><a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> (database), and</li>
						<li><a href="http://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/">libbsd</a> (Linux compatibility, if applicable),</li>
						<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libCURL</a> (e-mailing),</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.libexpat.org/">libexpat</a> (parsing Mechanical Turk responses), and</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki">json-c</a> (testing system).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If you're running without a connection to the Internet, you'll also need to download the <a
							href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> icon set and adjust
						the <a href="#compiling">Compilation</a> flags to point to your local copy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each of these systems has its own installation procedure beyond the scope of this document.
						After you've installed the dependencies, download the source archive and the checksum.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can download the latest <span class="nm">gamelab</span> source code from the <a
							href="snapshots">snapshots</a> directory, or browse the source on the readonly
						<a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/gamelab">GitHub</a> repository.
						This also contains all previous releases.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="compiling">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Compiling</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Move the <span class="file">gamelab.tgz</span> source code into a source directory (we suggest <span
							class="file">~/Source</span> or <span class="file">~/src</span> and unpack.
						First, however, verify the checksum.
						These instructions are valid for new installations and for upgrades: the source archive will
						unpack as <span class="file">gamelab-MAJOR-MINOR-BUILD</span>, so you won't overwrite previous
						installations on upgrading.
					</p>
					<p>
						<kbd>openssl dgst -sha512 gamelab.tgz | cmp - gamelab.tgz.sha512</kbd>
						<br />
						<kbd>tar zxf gamelab.tgz &amp;&amp; rm -f gamelab.tgz</kbd>
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you've unpacked the source code, you need to compile the server.
						You can override variables in the <span class="file">Makefile</a> by specifying a <span
							class="file">Makefile.local</span>, which will be automatically sourced.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="adminuri"><code>ADMINURI</code></dt>
						<dd>
							This is the administrative CGI URI relative to the server root.
							It will correspond to the mapped location of <a href="#cgibin"><code>CGIBIN</code></a>
							plus the script name.
							This is often <span class="file">/cgi-bin/admin</span>.
						</dd>
						<dt id="cgibin"><code>CGIBIN</code></dt>
						<dd>
							This is the path used for installing compiled (executable) CGI binaries.

						<dt><code>HTURI</code></dt>
						<dd>
							This is the mapped location of the <a href="#htdocs"><code>HTDOCS</code></a> variable.
							In most web servers, this defaults to <span class="file">/</span> (the root).
						</dd>
						<dt id="laburi"><code>LABURI</code></dt>
						<dd>
							This is the player (laboratory) CGI URI relative to the server root.
							It will correspond to the mapped location of <a href="#cgibin"><code>CGIBIN</code></a>
							plus the script name.
							This is often <span class="file">/cgi-bin/lab</span>.

						</dd>
						<dt id="static"><code>STATIC</code></dt>

						<h3>Installation</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Once you've <a href="#compiling">compiled</a> the software and configured its parameters, you
						can install it by simply running <kbd>make installcgi</kbd>.
						(You'll probably need to do <kbd>sudo make installcgi</kbd>, however.)
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Warning</strong>: this will overwrite any existing database!
						To update an existing installation (assuming the database hasn't changed&mdash;the release notes
						for each version will tell you), use <kbd>make updatecgi</kbd> or <kbd>sudo make updatecgi</kbd>.
						I <strong>do not</strong> recommend this, as it's easy to miss a small database change.
						<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> does not provide any facility for modifying the database
						in-flight.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both of these steps will install the following files.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Administrative CGI executables are installed into <a
								href="#cgibin"><code>CGIBIN</code></a>.
							These files are identical but for the suffix.
							These must resolve to <a href="#adminuri"><code>ADMINURI</code></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Laboratory CGI executables are installed into <a href="#cgibin"><code>CGIBIN</code></a>.
							These files are identical but for the suffix.
							These must resolve to <a href="#laburi"><code>LABURI</code></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Statically-served, read-only, web-server accessible files are installed into <a
								href="#htdocs"><code>HTDOCS</code></a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Read-only data files are installed into <a href="#datadir"><code>DATADIR</code></a>.
							They are used by the CGI processes to serve content to data requests.
							For example, there are a number of e-mail templates that are used by <span
								class="nm">gamelab</span> to programmatically send mails.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						If you run <kbd>make installcgi</kbd> (instead of <kbd>make updatecgi</kbd>), the following will also
						be installed.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The writable database file itself, installed into <a
								href="#datadir"><code>DATADIR</code></a>.
							This is initialised to the defaults described in the <a
								href="#administration">Experimenters</a> section.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						There are a number of file-system requirements to which you must be mindful.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The SQLite database system usually needs writable access to a <a
								href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/temp_directory.html">temporary directory</a>.
							If you're running in a file-system jail (e.g., OpenBSD), you'll need to make sure the
							temporary directory exists in the root of the jai.  On default installations, this
							consists of a <span class="file">tmp</span> directory in the document root, e.g., <span
								class="file">/var/www/tmp</span>, with writable permissions.
						</li>
						<li>
							The database directory itself needs file-creation permissions to allow for journalling
							(it uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead logging</a>).
						</li>
						<li>
							You will need the <span class="file">/dev/null</span> device in your file-system.  The
							file-system of the device directory must not be <code>nodev</code> in its mount options
							(see <a
								href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a>).
						</li>
						<li>
							If you're running in a file-system jail, the security measures of <a
								href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi">kcgi</a> on OpenBSD with <a
								href="http://man.openbsd.org/systrace.4">systrace(4)</a>
							(i.e., OpenBSD &lt;5.9) require a systrace device in the <span class="file">dev</span>
							directory of the document root, e.g., <span class="file">/var/www/dev</span>.  Moreover,
							the file-system of this directory must not be <code>nodev</code> in its mount options
							(see <a
								href="http://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a>).
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Experimenters</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					In this section, I describe how to create experiments on the <span class="nm">gamelab</span> system.
					I assume that you've just installed it following the <a href="#installation">Installation</a> section or
					that your system administrator has done so.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> experiments consist of a series of games (normal form bimatrices) played
					by a set of participants over a finite number of rounds of a certain amount of time.
					When the experiment is over, you run a lottery that selects a participant as a winner of the experiment.
					Thus, to run an experiment, you'll need players, games, and a duration of time split into rounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can only run one experiment at a time on each <span class="nm">gamelab</span> installation.
					However, you can back up and wipe the experiment installation database&mdash;starting over&mdash;at any
					time to start over.
				</p>
				<section id="createexperiments">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Creating Experiments</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Begin by accessing the experimenter URL with your browser.
						This will usually look like <span class="url">http://foo.com/cgi-bin/admin</span>, but it
						depends on how your system administrator has configured the system.
						You will be taken to a page prompting for an e-mail and password.
						<strong>Note</strong>: you'll need to configure your browser to accept cookies and run
						JavaScript for the domain upon which <span class="nm">gamelab</span> is running.
					</p>
					<p>
						The default e-mail address is <samp>foo@example.com</samp> and the default password is
						<samp>xyzzy</samp>.
						If the system has been properly configured, you'll be logged in.
						<strong>Note</strong>: you can log out at any time by clicking the navigation bars in the upper
						left-hand corner, then selecting <q>Logout</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first thing you should do upon logging in is change the experimenter e-mail address and
						password using the <q>Change Password</q> and <q>Change E-mail</q> sections of the
						experimenter console.
						Set the experimenter e-mail to be your own e-mail address and the password to something fairly
						complicated.
						You'll be logged out&mdash;and must log back in&mdash;after each step.
						Make sure that no participants will be able to guess (or know) your credentials!
					</p>
					<p>
						The next step is optional e-mail configuration in the <q>E-mail Server</q> section.
						You can run some experiments (e.g., captive-only) without e-mail support, but you won't be able
						to e-mail yourself the database.
						So it's best to set this.
						You may need your system administrator's help, but you should be able to enter the same information as
						when you configure your e-mail reader: 
						the <q>from</q> address the e-mails will use (usually your own so that they can respond to you);
						the outgoing (SMTP) e-mail server in the form <samp>smtp://foo.bar:587</samp>; 
						and the user and password for accessing that server.
						<span class="nm">Gamelab</span> won't work for non-secure (i.e., non-TLS) e-mail access.
						When you're finished entering this information, test the configuration.
						You should receive an e-mail in a few minutes from the <span class="nm">gamelab</span> server.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, the experiment itself.
						Start with a set of normal form bimatrix games in the <q>Games</q> section.
						These can have any number of strategies and either positive integer or rational payoffs.
						Enter these games into the <q>Games</q> section.
						Bimatrix games are laid out top-left to bottom-right.
						So let's say you have the following game shown first as a symmetric game then with the
						<span style="color: red;">implied payoffs</span> to the opponent player.
					</p>
					<div id="gamepanes" class="gamepanes">
						<div>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<td>1</td>
									<td>0</td>
									<td>-1</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>0</td>
									<td>-1</td>
									<td>1</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>-1</td>
									<td>1</td>
									<td>0</td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</div>
						<div>
							<table>
								<tr>
									<td>1<span>, -1</span></td>
									<td>0<span>, 0</span></td>
									<td>-1<span>, 1</span></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>0<span>, 0</span></td>
									<td>-1<span>, 1</span></td>
									<td>1<span>, -1</span></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>-1<span>, 1</span></td>
									<td>1<span>, -1</span></td>
									<td>0<span>, 0</span></td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						These would decompose into <kbd class="gamepayoffs">1 <span>-1</span> 0 <span>0</span> -1
							<span>1</span> 0 <span>0</span> -1 <span>1</span> 1 <span>-1</span> -1 <span>1</span> 1
							<span>-1</span> 0 <span>0</span></kbd>, where opponent payoffs are <span style="color:
							red;">coloured</span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, specify a set of participants identified by e-mail address in the <q>Participants</q> section.
						Identifiers may be separated by white-space (newlines, tabs, spaces).
						You'll see valid identifiers noted after submitting the form.
						If you specify <q>Allow captive participants</q>, participants can register themselves by
						accessing the <span class="file">playerautoadd.html</span> URL <strong>from the moment
							you submit the form</strong>, so you may see participants appear as they add
						themselves.
						They are captive in the sense that their logout button is disabled and that they are
						never e-mailed (their identifiers are free-form, not e-mail addresses), nor are they
						retained if the database is wiped.
						Captive mode is disabled when you start an experiment: 
						this is a security measure so that participants can't join after you've started.
						You can opt to allow participants to continually join by specifying that captive mode should
						be preserved when the experiment begins.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you've added your games and your participants, you're ready for the experiment configuration as
						assigned in <q>Experiment Parameters</q>.
						Start with the simple options (don't click on <q>Show Advanced Options</q> yet.)
						Begin with the time and date when the experiment begins, the
						number of rounds, duration of each round, and a fraction of participants that will cause the round to
						advance before the maximum time has elapsed.
						(You can set this to zero to force the maximum time to elapse before the round advances.)
						For example, if set to 50%, then 50% or more participants playing all games in both roles will cause
						the round to advance regardless the amount of time left.
						If there are zero participants in either player role, then it's as if nobody plays, making the
						round run until the maximum time elapses.
						The minimum time per round is one moment; the minimum number of rounds is one round.
					</p>
					<p>
						The advanced options allow for finer control&mdash;be careful in using these!
						See the <a href="#mechanicalturk">Mechanical Turk</a> section for adding Mechanical Turk workers
						to your experiment.
					</p>
					<p>
						The login URL is used when sending non-captive participants the welcome e-mail.
						Their query string credentials will be appended to the given URL.
						You don't want to change this unless, for example, the laboratory CGI script is sitting in
						another URL path.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can customise the instructions shown to participants by choosing from a set of pre-made
						instructions or providing your own.
						If you provide your own, it's up to you to make sure that the instructions are a well-formatted
						HTML5 fragment.
						Review the existing instructions on how to customise.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can customise round advancement in several ways.
						The first is limiting the total number of rounds per participant.
						Thus, if one specifies 10 total rounds and 5 rounds per participant, each participant will play
						at most five rounds.
						This is useful for running with captive participants that can join and participant over an extended
						period of play time.
						The minimum-time (in minutes) establishes a <q>grace time</q> for play.
						This is especially useful when &lt;100% of participants play before the round automatically
						advances to prevent <q>fast participants</q> from having an unfair advantage.
						Lastly, the maximum limit per round bounds the number of simultaneous participants.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are a number of option toggles in the last subsection.
						You can disable the lottery computation, which is useful for <a
							href="#mechanicalturk">Mechanical Turk</a> scenarios, so that participants are only
						shown their payoffs and not ranked and assigned lottery numbers.
						The questionnaire is a more significant option: if specified, participants are required to step
						through a series of questions before playing.
						<strong>Note</strong>: if you specify a questionnaire, participants will not automatically be
						<q>joined</q> to the experiment when it begins.
						In other words, until they finish the experiment, they will not be included in the count of
						current participants when looking at the fraction of completed game-plays per round.
						They join the round following the current one upon finishing the questionnaire.
						Lastly, you may specify that round advancement will trigger an e-mail to the participants.

						<h3>Running Experiments</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Once you've deployed your experiment, you must now administer it.
						You can enable and disable participants, reset participant passwords, and reconfigure your
						experimenter credentials.
						You can also review some statistics on the current experiment status.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a participant forgets her password, you can reset it by clicking on the participant's email
						address and selecting the <q>Reset Password</q> option.
						(Captive participants are <strong>not</strong> affected.)
						You can reset all non-captive participants' passwords with the <q>Reset All Passwords</q> option.
						If a participant is misbehaving, you can disable her login by toggling the button next to her
						e-mail address.
						Once toggled, she'll no longer be able to log in.
						If she's already logged in, she'll be logged out; no plays are accepted.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you misconfigured the e-mail server and no e-mails were sent out, you can retry the failed
						e-mail attempts by re-configuring (correctly!) the server and selecting <q>Resend Error
							Mails</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						When an experiment has finished and you have provided a lottery amount, you can compute its
						lottery by specifying a seed for the random number generator and a number of lottery winners.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the winner has been chosen and notified, and the game wound down, you can wipe and start
						afresh by selecting the <q>Wipe Experiment</q> option.
						This will first back up the database (e-mailing it to you in the process), then wipe all by the
						experimenter credentials, listed games, and participant identities (though not their play, of
						course).
						Note that captive participants are not retained if the database is wiped.

					<h2>Mechanical Turk</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Mechanical Turk</a> is a system for allowing human workers
					to participant in Internet-based tasks.
					It is part of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> product constellation.
					This section assumes a bit of familiarity with the Mechanical Turk system overall.
				</p>
				<section id="mturkexperiment">
					<header>
						<a href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-fw"></i></a>
						<h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Setting up a Mechanical Turk experiment is very easy.
						First, have your AWS access key identifier and secret key handy.
						Fill these in when configuring your experiment, then set the number of workers
						(corresponding to the <q>max assignments</q> in the <a
							href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_CreateHITOperation.html">API
							reference</a>),
						the reward amount (<q>reward</q> in the API), and 
						currency conversion (used when computing bonuses).
						You can use either the <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/developer/sandbox">Developer
							Sandbox</a> or production mode&#8212;I recommend starting with the first.
						You can also enter a name and a description, which will be shown to potential workers, as well
						as the keywords which are used when searching for HITs.
						Lastly, you can set some worker requirements.
						You can specify an assignment approval percent, number of accepted HITs, and locale.
						By default, there are no requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						You'll probably also want to use the Mechanical Turk instructions, and you should enable the
						questionnaire to control for workers' understanding of game-play.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you start your experiment, the request will be sent to either the sandbox or production
						server.
						We <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you use the sandbox server a few times to make sure
						that your HIT posts as you wish it to.
						If there are errors, you'll be notified of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note</strong>: when Mechanical Turk workers join the system, their session information
						is embedded in the query string.
						This is because most browsers disallow third-party cookies by default.
						So be warned that this is <strong>not</strong> a secure method of operation!

						<h3>Granting Bonuses</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						You can optionally assign bonuses to Mechanical Turk players in your experiment after the experiment has concluded.
						To do so, you'll need to click the <q>Assign bonus</q> button that appears beneath the high-scorer table on the experimenter page.
						This button is only shown for Mechanical Turk experiments.
						It's ok to click this twice: the Mechanical Turk system will keep track of who has been awarded
						bonuses and not award the same bonus twice.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bonuses are only awarded to Mechanical Turk players who have indicated completion.
						You can see which players have done so by looking whether they have checkmarks next to their identifiers in the player listing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The bonus assigned is the number of tickets times the conversion rate.

					You can, however, directly access the <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> game database by

					<h2>Programmable API</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					As described in the <a href="#technicalities">Technicalities</a> section, <span
						class="nm">gamelab</span> is at heart a web application making JSON requests of a server.
					This JSON interface is simple and easy to use to create a programmatic interface.
					If you wish to create a programmatic interface (a <q>bot</q>), and your experimenter consents, it's a
					fairly easy process.
					In fact, a tool already exists within the <span class="nm">gamelab</span> source distributions to stress
					test systems using this interface.
				</p>
				<p>
					To do this, you'll need a programming language that has support for JSON and making HTTP requests.
					In C, you can use <a href="https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki">json-c</a> and <a
						href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libCURL</a>, respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Note to developers</strong>: if you're writing your own bot, <strong>do not flood requests</strong>.
					Be courteous to other users: there is no competitive advantage to be gained by polling the system
					constantly.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Note to experimenters</strong>:
					in order to run a programmable experiment, you cannot use a <a href="#questionnaire">Questionnaire</a>,
					as questions are free-form.
					In theory, you could enable the questionnaire and have players play through it, then turn on their bots,

						<h3>General Sequence</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						The general sequence is as follows:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Get your username and password, or optionally, have your utility register with <a

						<li>
							Log in to <a href="#seq-dologin">dologin.json</a> with your username and password,
							accepting your session identifier as cookies.
						</li>
						<li>
							Wait for the experiment to begin by polling <a
								href="#seq-doloadexpr">doloadexpr.json</a>.
							Use your session identifier as an identifier cookie.
						</li>
						<li>
							Accept the experiment data from <a href="#seq-doloadexpr">doloadexpr.json</a>.
							Use your session identifier as an identifier cookie.
						</li>
						<li>
							Using the experiment data from <a href="#seq-doloadexpr">doloadexpr.json</a>,
							construct and submit a series of game plays to <a href="#seq-doplay">doplay.json</a>.
							Use your session identifier as an identifier cookie.

							Use your session identifier as an identifier cookie.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Do not flood the system with requests: be considerate!

						<h3>Resources</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						This section describes the resources (URLs) that may be accessed for programmatic play.
						Each of these resources is the immediate path following the laboratory CGI script name, for
						example, if you're running as <span class="file">localhost/lab.cgi</span>, these would be mapped
						to <span class="file">localhost/lab.cgi/doautoadd.json</span>.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="seq-doautoadd">doautoadd.json (POST)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Post your e-mail address using the <code>ident</code> field name.
								Returns HTTP error code 
								400 (invalid or missing e-mail field), 
								403 (player by that e-mail already exists),
								404 (captive players disallowed), or
								200 (success).
								Upon success, the return body is a JSON object consisting of the <code>ident</code> and
								<code>password</code> string fields.
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="seq-dologin">dologin.json (POST)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Post your e-mail address (or identifier) and password using the <code>ident</code> and
								<code>password</code> field names.
								Returns HTTP error code
								400 (invalid or missing input fields),
								409 (experiment not started yet), 
								200 (success).
								If you receive HTTP error code 409, wait and continue polling: the experiment is not yet
								accepting player logins.
								Upon success, the return body is empty, but the cookie field consists of
								<code>sessid</code>, your session identifiers (a number); and <code>sesscookie</code>, a
								magic number attached to your identifier.
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="seq-doloadexpr">doloadexpr.json (GET)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Get a <a href="#obj-expr">doloadexpr</a> object describing the full experiment.
								You will need to pass the <code>sessid</code> and <code>sesscookie</code> cookie fields
								as described in <a href="#seq-dologin">dologin.json</a>.
								Returns HTTP error code
								304 (not changed since last request),
								409 (experiment not started yet),
								429 (player accepted, but not yet joined for play),
								200 (success).
								If you receive HTTP error code 409 or 429, wait and continue polling: the experiment is
								not yet started or has started, but you are not allowed to join yet.
								Upon success, returns the JSON experiment object.
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="seq-doplay">doplay.json (POST)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Post a probability mixture for a game's actions.
								You will need to pass the <code>sessid</code> and <code>sesscookie</code> cookie fields
								as described in <a href="#seq-dologin">dologin.json</a>.
								The game identifier and round must be encoded in the <code>gid</code> and
								<code>round</code> fields, respectively.
								Each action with a requested probability must be posted as field <code>indexNNN</code>,
								where <code>N</code> is the action index (starting at zero), e.g.,
								<code>index0</code>, <code>index1</code>, and so on.
								Probabilities may be decimal or fractional strings.
								Missing actions are assigned zero probability.
								Actions greater than the maximum action are ignored.
								Returns HTTP error code
								400 (invalid game, round, or probability, or probability sum doesn't equal one), 
								409 (round has passed or is being played again, experiment hasn't started or has
								finished, or player hasn't joined), or
								200 (success).
								<strong>Note</strong>: the error codes for this resource are likely to become more
								specific in future releases.

						<h3>Objects</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						When using the <a href="#api">Programmable API</a> via the web <a
							href="#resources">Resources</a>, you'll need to examine some JSON objects to ascertain
						the experiment status.
						The following defines the objects available to you by resource.
						The type of each field is listed alongside the field name: object for dictionaries (i.e., things
						that contain other things), strings being UTF-8 strings, integers being 64-bit signed integers,
						doubles being double-precision floating points, and times being seconds since UNIX epoch.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many undocumented fields that are transmitted while playing: these are to be
						considered unstable and will not be included in subsequent releases.
					</p>
					<dl>

							<p>
								Obtained from a successful <a href="#seq-doloadexpr">doloadexpr.json</a> request, i.e.,
								with an HTTP error code 200 and a parsed JSON object.
								The resulting dictionary consists of the following top-level fields.
							</p>
							<dl>
								<dt id="obj-expr"><var>expr</var> (object)</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										Object describing the experiment status.

											styling may make the data non-obvious.
										</dd>
										<dt><var>minutes</var> (integer)</dt>
										<dd>
											The maximum number of minutes per round (all games).

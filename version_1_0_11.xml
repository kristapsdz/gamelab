			When logging in (either via JSON, such as with captive players, or via HTML as when using the form page or initial
			e-mail), have the system detect whether the lobby should be used or the home page.
			This prevents a needless and at times confusing redirect after hitting the homepage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lots of aesthetic clean-up for the experimenter: more straight-forward status, cleaner buttons to push, a status graph
			to see how many participants have played, an a printout of the current top earners (by tickets, not payoff).

			Also clean up the presentation of earnings for players: one style for lottery-less play, another for playing with the lottery.
			This involved some internal simplification of how lotteries are computed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stipulate a valid user e-mail address only for participants added over the experimenter console.
			Otherwise, identifiers can be free-form.
			This allows captive players to use non-email-based identifiers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, significantly improve the <q>bot</q> playing utility to handle multiple games and randomised (instead of
			consistent) strategies.

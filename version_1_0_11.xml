			When logging in (either via JSON, such as with captive players, or via HTML as when using the form page or initial
			e-mail), have the system detect whether the lobby should be used or the home page.
			This prevents a needless and at times confusing redirect after hitting the homepage.

		<p>
			Lots of aesthetic clean-up for the experimenter: more straight-forward status, cleaner buttons to push, and a status
			graph to see how many participants have played.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stipulate a valid user e-mail address only for participants added over the experimenter console.
			Otherwise, identifiers can be free-form.
			This allows captive players to use non-email-based identifiers.

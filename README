This document describes how to deploy the Gamelab system.  For
information on gamelab, see http://kcons.eu/gamelab.

Dependencies:

 - kcgi (http://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi)
 - sqlite3 (http://www.sqlite.org)
 - libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl)
 - CGI-capable web server (Apache, OpenBSD httpd + slowcgi, etc.)

By now, you've downloaded this source file.  First, you'll need to edit
the Makefile according to your installation directory.  Note that
relative directories are relative to the installed binary, so if you're
running in a chroot(2), the root is in the chroot(2).  Absolute
directories are relative to the file-system at installation time.

 - PREFIX: convenience variable for file-system base directory
 - HTDOCS: absolute directory of static JS and CSS files
 - HTURI: URL path of static JS and CSS files
 - CGIBIN: absolute directory of CGI scripts
 - DATADIR: absolute directory of CGI data (DB, XML templates)
 - RDATADIR: relative directory of CGI data
 - LIBS: extra libraries needed to compile
 - STATIC: whether to create static binaries

Samples are included for Mac OS X testing (per-user directory) and
OpenBSD ``production'' environments.

Note: DATADIR must be writable, as sqlite creates temporary files.  You
may also need a writable /tmp directory relative to the web-server root
for journal files.  Lastly, if you're on OpenBSD, make sure that the
/dev directory relative to the web-server root has the systrace device,
and that the file-system partition containing these directories is not
mounted nodev.

Next, compile the software.  It doesn't matter whether you use clang(1),
gcc(1), or another compiler: they all should work.

 $ make

Now install the software.  Whether you use sudo(8) or not is up to you.

 $ sudo make install

That's it!

Please let Kristaps, kristaps@kcons.eu, know of any problems with these
instructions.
